      <p>Controls base Toolkit processing by turning off the maplink-check and maplink targets, which has the effect of eliminating auto-generated related links. Note that explicitly-authored related links are not affected. This property cannot be set to true by default because it is a global property that affects all transformation types. You must set this property explicitly in order to suppress related links in the output.</p>
